Project: Mastermind ~ Ruby

This is one of the first "big" projects in TOP.
It is a classic terminal-rendition of the game Mastermind.

Instructions are not included.

Things I learned:

Logical thinking (the peg logic).

File organization (modules and requires).

Object-Oriented basics (the Player class).

Bonus: I learned a lot about Ascii art (I wonder if that will be useful)
